MOTIVATION:

Tests are conducted to assess student's knowledge in a subject, grading them,
to give admission to higher education, placements, scholarships, etc. Hence, a
question paper must be set in a way that can measure the change in the level of
students' knowledge in a particular subject. Therefore, a good amount of care
and caution is necessary for setting question papers. The types of question
papers differ with the objective of the examination.

The process of setting a new question paper for an examination could be
cumbersome and tedious when one has to dig through old archives and comply with
the guidelines at the same time. A centralized, one-size-fits-all approach to
collaborative setting of papers either do not exist or are not intuitive
enough to be popular.

One has to keep in mind the difficulty level of each question, check questions
against previous papers, and still cover the various topics or skills that need
to be assessed. This mental overhead hampers setting up quality papers.

An aspirant usually covers her syllabi in a topic-wise fashion, wherein
applications of multiple topics or skills come in later than application of
individual topics. However, question banks usually do not account for this
distinction between topics covered and not covered. Thus, a practice session
tailored for individual needs is not trivially set up.
